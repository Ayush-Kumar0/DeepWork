        <!--Definitions-->
        <div id="Second" class="para">
            <dfn>Deep Work</dfn>: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
            <br /><br /><dfn>Shallow Work</dfn>: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
            <br /><br /><dfn>The Deep Work Hypothesis</dfn>: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly <em>rare</em> at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly <em>valuable</em> in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.
            <br /><br /><strong>Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy</strong><br />
            <ul>
                <li>The ability to quickly master hard things.</li>
                <li>The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.</li>
            </ul><br />
            High-Quality Work Produced=(Time Spent)×(Intensity of Focus)
            <br /><br /><dfn>The Metric Black Hole</dfn>: Generally speaking, as knowledge work makes more complex demands of the labour force, it becomes harder to measure the value of an individual's efforts.
            <br /><br /><dfn>The Principle of Least Resistance</dfn>:In a business setting,without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviours to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviours that are easiest in the moment.
            <br /><br /><dfn>Busyness as Proxy for Productivity</dfn>: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.
            <br /><br><strong>"Grand Unified Theory" of the mind</strong>: Like fingers pointing to the moon, other diverse disciplines from anthropology to education, behavioural economics to family counseling, similarly suggest that the skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.
            <br /><br /><strong>Examples of Depth Philosophy:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Monastic Philosophy</li>
                <li>The Bimodal Philosophy</li>
                <li>The Rythmic Philosophy</li>
                <dd>This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit.</dd>
                <li>The Journalistic Philosophy</li>
            </ul>
            <br /><strong>The 4 Principles of Execution:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Focus on the Wildly Important</li>
                <dd>"If you want to win the war of attention, don't try to say 'no' to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say 'yes' to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else."—<b>David Brooks</b></dd>
                <li>Act on the Lead Measures</li>
                <dd>For an individual focused on deep work, it's easy to identify the relevant lead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal.</dd>
                <li>Keep a Compelling Scoreboard</li>
                <li>Create a Cadence of Accountability</li>
            </ul>
            <br />Unconscious Thought Theory(UUT)
            <br /><br />Attention Restoration Theory(ART)
            <br /><br />Memorize a deck of cards
            <br /><br /><dfn>The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection</dfn>: You're justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or <i>anything</i> you might possibly miss out on if you don't use it.
            <br /><br /><dfn>The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection</dfn>: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.
            <br /><br /><dfn>The Law of the Vital Few</dfn>: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.
            <br><br><strong>Strategies to drain the shallows:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Schedule every minute of your day</li>
                <li>Quantify the depth of every activity</li>
                <li>Ask your boss for a shallow work budget</li>
                <li>Finish your work by five thirty</li>
                <li>Become hard to reach</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make people who send you e-mail do more work</li>
                    <li>Do more work when you send or reply to e-mails</li>
                    <li>Don't respond</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Professorial E-mail Sorting:</strong> Do not reply to an e-mail message if any of the following applies:
            <ul>
                <li>It's ambiguous or otherwise makes it hard for you to generate a reasonable response.</li>
                <li>It's not a question or proposal that interests you.</li>
                <li>Nothing really good would happen if you did respond and nothing really bad would happen if you didn't.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Intext Sentences</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Deep work, though a burden to prioritize, was crucial for his(<b>Carl Jung</b>) goal of changing the world.</li>
                <li>Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you <em>permanently</em> reduce your capacity to perform deep work.</li>
                <li>Our work culture's shift toward the shallow(whether you think it's philosophically good or bad) is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth.</li>
                <li>To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you are capable of producing—a task that requires depth.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Deep Work Is Valuable</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>We are in the early throes of a Great Restructuring.</li>
                <li>Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind.</li>
                <li>Those with the oracular ability to work with and tease valuable results out of increasingly complex machines thrive.</li>
                <li>Once the talent market is made universally accessible, those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer.</li>
                <li>People experiencing <em>attention-residue</em> after switching tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next task.</li>
                <li>To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.</li>
                <li>Unless your talent and skills absolutely dwarf those of your competition, the deep workers among them will outproduce you.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Deep Work Is Rare</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Even though you are not aware at the time, the brain responds to distractions.</li>
                <li>Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not.</li>
                <li>The alternative, to not embrace all things Internet, is, as [Neil] Postman would say, "invisible and therefore irrelevant."</li>
                <li>Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values like <em>quality craftsmanship, and mastery</em> that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnological.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Deep Work Is Meaningful</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The satisfactions of manisfesting oneself concretely in the world through manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and easy.</li>
                <li>Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.</li>
                <li>Intense concentration hijacks your attention apparatus, preventing you from noticing the many smaller and less pleasant things that unavoidably and persistently populate our lives.</li>
                <li>The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effect to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.</li>
                <li>Any pursuit—be it physical or cognitive—that supports high level of skill can also generate a sense of sacredness.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Work Deeply</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.</li>
                <li>You must be careful to choose a philosophy that fits your specific circumstances, as a mismatch here can derail your deep work habit before it has a chance to solidify.</li>
                <li>[Great creative minds] think like artists but work like accountants.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Grand Gestures</strong> push your deep goal to a level of mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources.</li>
                <li>The presence of the other party waiting for your next insight—be it someone physically in the same room or collaborating with you virtually—can short-circuit the natural instinct to avoid depth.</li>
                <li>Providing your conscious brain time to rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting through your most complex professional challenges.</li>
                <li>The <em>directed attention</em> is finite: If you exhaust it, you'll struggle to concentrate.</li>
                <li>The core mechanism of ART is the idea that you can restore your ability to direct your attention if you give this activity a rest.</li>
                <li>For a novice, somewhere around an hour a day of intense concentration seems to be a limit, while for experts this number can expand to as many as four hours&mdash;but rarely more.</li>
                <li>Any you fit into the night won't be the type of high-value activity that really advance your career; your efforts will instead be confined to low-value shallow tasks(executed at a slow, low-energy pace).</li>
                <li>Shutdown Ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been revieved and that for each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan that you trust for its completion, or (2) it's captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Embrace Boredom</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction.</li>
                <li>The Internet is seductive: You may think you're just retrieving a single key e-mail from your inbox, but you'll find it hard to not glance at the other "urgent" messages that have recently arrived.</li>
                <li>To succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli.</li>
                <li>Like <abbr title="Theodore Roosevelt">Roosevelt</abbr> at Harvard, attack the task with every free neuron until it gives way under your unwavering barrage of concentration.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Quit Social Media</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If you don't attempt to weigh pros against cons, but instead use any glimpse of some potential benefit as justification for unrestrained use of a tool, then you're unwittingly crippling your ability to succeed in the world of knowledge work.</li>
                <li>The notion that identifying some benefit is sufficient to invest money, time, and attention in a tool is near laughable to people in <abbr title="Forrest Pritchard">his</abbr> trade.</li>
                <li>Assuming that you could probably list somewhere between ten and fifteen distinct and potentially beneficial activities for each of your life goals, this law says thay it's the top two or three such activites&mdash;the number that this strategy asks you to focus on&mdash;that make most of the difference in whether or not you succeed with the goal.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Drain the Shallows</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fewer official working hours help squeeze the fat out of the typical workweek. Once everyone has less time to get their work done, they respect that time even more. People become stingy with their time and that's a good thing. They don't waste it on things that just don't matter. When you have fewer hours you usually spend them more wisely.</li>
                <li>It's difficult to prevent the trivial from creeping into every corner of your schedule if you don't face, without finching, your current balance between deep and shallow work, and then adopt the habbit of pausing before action and asking, "What makes the most sense right now?"</li>
                <li>Your goal is not stick to a given schedule at all costs; it's instead to maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you're doing with your time going forward&mdash;even if these decisions are reworked again and again as the day unfolds.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>To leave the distracted masses to join the focused few, I'm arguing, is a transformative experience.</li>
                <li>There's an uneasiness that surrounds any effort to produce the best things you're capable of producing, as this forces you to confront the possibility that your best is not (yet) that good.</li>
            </ol>
